## Educational-Role-play-Game-Avatar-Inferences
### Challenge description
Dataset: gain insights from the player data from the Play2Prevent lab's PlayForward: Elm City game <br>

### Project Aim
Thesis questions<br> 
*To what extent do playing experiences differ for students with different avatars? How do we characterize playing experience and categorize students based on it?*

### Tools/packages
- R: data clean up & factor building<br> 
- Panda: data combination & manipulation<br> 
- Sklearn: data clustering & analysis<br> 
- Matplotlib/Plotly: 3D visualization<br> 

### Approach
- Distill to related variables: <br> 
Avatars types (age, gender, ethnicity) Game experience (stack progress/session, total playtime, average skill points/session) <br>
- Categorize players with K-Means clustering on normalized data <br>
- Examine game experiences among different avatars by coloring based on avatar types <br>
- Performing ANOVA test to compare group means<br>

### Conclusion:
- Homogeneity in game experiences for the current student pool <br>
- Increasing avatar diversity would create a higher level of game feature specialization => <br>
- => Player immersion is key to improved educational outcome in a more diverse student body
